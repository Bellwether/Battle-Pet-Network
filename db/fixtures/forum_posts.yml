        The sooner we discuss this the better, for at the moment I've not quite settled on a canonical name, or brand, for the game. My thoughts on branding are based on a few considerations. 

        Initially, I had thought it would best to have a single game system, with a different front-end game supporting different breeds, so cats, dogs, beasts, etc. The idea was to have a suite of apps, based on animal. Hence, the Battle Pet *Network*, where you'd then have Battle Cat, Battle Dog, Battle Beast, and so on. Thus, www.battletpet.net, and @battlepet. This seemed to be a way to get "more bang for our game design buck" as it were, but I've since re-examined this assumption.

        The downside, in actuality, is that the brand is diluted, _especially_ amongst casual players, and it would probably be better to consolidate the players as much together as possible than to separate them by artificial 'games'. We would still want to move on to other species of pets, but I now suspect this is a problem to be solved more in the UI and UX side of things, instead of by some silly franchising.

        That said, we need:

        * Facebook app name
        * website
        * Twitter account
        * App Store name

        I'm inclined to leave the website as battlepet.net and the twitter @battlepet, because I think those are solid names (although I picked up a bunch of similar domains). This means that the Facebook app should probably change its name to match. This isn't a huge deal, but the operative question is: "what should the official name be"? This is the name that shows up in banner images (and which we'll need font/art for), and the name by which we want people to know our work.

        Any thoughts? At the moment, I'm leaning to our current convention of "The Battle Pet Network" as the formal name, with "Battle Pet" being our shorthand. A final, albeit comparatively trivial question, is whether "Battle Pet" should be one or two words; "Battlepet". I slightly prefer two words, because it's easier for the eye to read and allows the initialism "BPN".

      Cash shop purchases are currently made using PayPal. Facebook is currently piloting its Coins program, and we'll probably eventually use those in addition to or in lieu of PayPal checkouts.
      
      Right now I've only implemented PayPal Express, which requires the user to already have a PayPal account. When it becomes meaningful to do so, I'll go ahead and add basic CC purchasing support as well. For now, Express gives us more than enough to test with, however.
      
      The game is currently running in PayPal's sandbox mode, so real account holders cannot complete any transactions. Instead, please use the following sandbox account to login to PayPal and test cash shop purchases.

      ### Today

      So, the game is feature-complete to the point of everything described in the [guidebook](http://apps.facebook.com/battlecat/guide). All the rules covered there are functional, and should be working as described.

      #### Testing

      There is already an great deal of automated test code (~1:1 ratio of code to tests) in place that should catch a good deal of logic and programmatic errors, but there are still UI problems and other issues to consider.

      SANITY TESTING

      I'm pretty confident that we won't see many crashing bugs or other glaring errors, and for what it's worth, whenever we discover a bug, I write a test to ensure the problem won't regress back into the codebase at a later date. 

      A good round of excessive clicking around and trying to break forms with bad input should hopefully reveal any user-facing stuff that's slipped through the cracks, and that's what we need now: a general sanity test of the app.

      The infancy of the UI makes any deeper testing difficult right now, since there's little guidance on the flow of things from the layout, design, and copy. The other two things which impede testing right now are lack of content, and lack of gameplay balance.

      CONTENT

      The game needs more content in the way of sentients, items, and humans in order to better mode how things like occupations will pay off, and to test the various combinations of bonuses to ensure there aren't any odd side effects.

      As far as content goes, I'll be adding a suitable test bed of available stuff to play with in the next couple of weeks.

      BALANCE

      The power of the breeds, items, the price of things, the difficulty in taming and retaining humans, scavenging and foraging, etc. are all currently set to somewhat arbitrary values. There are undoubtably broken builds, frustrating difficulty levels, slow advancement, and other gross imbalances. I've obviously tried to set the starting values of things to sane levels, but actual gameplay is required to really work this out.

      This is where testers come in, so _anyone_, feel free to invite others to come and help playlets. 

      The other thing I'll be doing is adding a number of administrative features so we can easily tweak our data and run simulations for combat and such.

      ### Tomorrow

      In the next week or so I'll be hopefully finalizing any functional issues to the point that everything in the [guidebook](http://apps.facebook.com/battlecat/guide) is 100% working and tested. I'll also be adding additional content.

      #### Staff Tools

      I'll also be adding a staff forum and access control, as well as some admin panel controls. We'll also need to open discussion on layout and design, which to some degree precedes any art requirements.
