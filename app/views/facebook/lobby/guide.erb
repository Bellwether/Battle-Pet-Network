  <h3 id="combat">Combat</h3>
  <p>Battle between pets is the centerpiece of the game. Called 'Undercut', the combat system is based around a simple number-guessing game from which many possible strategies emerge. Before combat each pet chooses their actions in secret, trying to predict their opponent's moves in advance and outsmart them with a better tactical response.</p>
  <p>Pets 'attack' each other by issuing challenges, which the 'defender' can decide to accept or decline at their leisure. Before battle, both pets pick a sequence of actions to form their 'strategy' for that battle, and once strategies are chosen the combat unfolds automatically by comparing the pet's respective actions. Pets can lose the battle through too many wounds, or by sheer exhaustion.</p>
  <p>After the battle the winning pet receives an 'experience' award for their victory, with additional experience bonuses possible through a variety of means. The more your pet fights, the more experience they will accumulate, and the more powerful they will become in battle.</p>

  <h4>Actions</h4>
  <p>Actions are types of maneuvers your pet can perform in battle, such as slashing with their claws, biting, or dodging to safety. There are two types of actions: offensive and defense. Each action also has a power, ranging from one to eight, where offensive actions are always even-numbered (2, 4, 6, 8) and defensive are always odd-numbered (1, 3, 5, 7).</p>
  <p>Every pet starts the game with an identical set of the eight main actions, but while difficult it is still possible to learn rare and special actions if your pet is dedicated enough to the art of battle.</p>
  <p>The basic actions are:</p>
  <p>
	Offensive:
	<ul>
      <li>2. scratch</li>
	  <li>4. slash</li>
	  <li>6. claw</li>
	  <li>8. bite</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
    Defensive:
    <ul>
	  <li>1. swat</li>
	  <li>3. flank</li>
	  <li>5. dodge</li>
	  <li>6. leap</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h4>Favorite Actions</h4>
  <p>Each pet breed has a favorite action which pets of the breed prefer to fight with, and which characterizes the breed. This is your pet's favorite breed action. Your pet may also choose a personal favorite action, which they wish to characterize their personal fighting style. You can set your pet's favorite action from their profile.</p>
  <p>Whenever your pet uses strategies including one or more of their favorite actions they will receive a minor experience bonus, regardless of who wins the battle, in recognition of their 'fighting in style'. The bonus is equal to the number of favorite actions appearing in their strategy, so if you use the same favorite action for 3 of the strategy's maneuvers, your pet will receive a bonus 3 experience.</p>

  <h4>Strategies</h4>
  <p>Before issuing or responding to a challenge, your pet must build a strategy to use in the battle. To build a strategy, you'll simply select a list of actions that your pet wishes to use and order them in the desired sequence. Your opponent will do the same, and then to resolve the battle each fighter's actions will be compared in order (rolling around to the first action if necessary) until one of the fighters has defeated the other.</p>
  <p>Your pet's strategies can include a number of actions equal to their intelligence. The more actions you include, the more you can diversify your tactics and the more experience you can gain from using your favorite actions. As a consequence, more intelligent pets tend to earn experience quicker if they take full advantage of their intelligence.</p>
  <p>Once you've built a strategy, it will be saved for your pet and you can select that strategy again for reuse in any future battles. Over time you can experiment with which strategies prove the most victorious for your pet. It's possible to review and delete strategies at any time from your pet's combat profile.</p>

  <h4>The Undercut Combat System</h4>
  <p>Combat in Undercut revolves around a single idea: try to pick the highest number you can that is still lower than the number your opponent has picked.</p>
  <p>Because every combat action your pet can perform is assigned a power, in general you'll want to pick the highest powered actions you think that you can get away with. An 'Undercut' occurs when your pet performs an action whose power is exactly one less than their opponent's action - this is the best outcome you can hope for, and not only is your pet's damage doubled for undercuts, but they also receive an experience bonus.</p>
  <p>When two fighters battle, the actions in their strategies are compared for a number of rounds until the battle ends. If the last action of a fighter's strategy is reached, then the strategy will simply start again from its first action.</p>
  <p>The outcome each round depends on the type and power of the respective actions, and there are six possible outcomes:</p>
  <ol>
	<li>Both defend: nothing happens.</li>
	<li>Both attack: each fighter deals their action's power in damage to the other.</li>
	<li>One fighter attacks with higher power, the other defends with lower power: the attacker deals the action's power in damage to the defender, minus the defender's action's power.</li>
	<li>One fighter attacks with lower power, the other defenders with higher power: the attacker deals their action's power in damage to the defender.</li>
	<li>Attacker undercuts defender: the attacker deals double their action's power in damage to the defender.</li>
	<li>Defender undercuts attacker: the defender deals double the attacker's own action's power in damage to the attacker.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There are two ways to loose a battle in undercut:</p>
  <p>First: When an action deals damage to a fighter, that fighter's health decreases, and when a fighter's health reaches zero they fall unconscious and lose the battle.</p>
  <p>Second: Whenever a fighter performs an action, that fighter's endurance decreases by an amount equal to the action's power, and when a fighter's endurance reaches zero, they collapse in exhaustion and lose the battle. Note, offensive actions cost twice their power in endurance, while defensive actions only cost their power.</p>
  <p>A battle continues until one of the fighters reaches zero health or endurance.</p>

  <h4>Tips</h4>
  <p>
	Q: How many actions to use in a strategy?<br />
    A: As many as you can, since there's a greater potential for experience awards.
  </p>
  <p>
	Q: When to use offensive vs. defensive actions?<br />
    A: You'll obviously need to use defensive moves if you think you know your enemy's action and are trying to undercut them. Otherwise, defensive actions are useful in conserving endurance over the course of the battle, while offensive actions are necessary to deal damage.<p>
  <p>
	Q: When to use high vs low power actions?<br />
    A: Higher powered actions use more endurance and are easier to undercut, but deal/defend more damage. Lower power actions conserve your endurance, and are safer, but are weaker.</p>
  <p>
	Q: How often to battle?<br />
    A: As often as your pet's endurance can afford it. Entering a battle with weakened endurance is riskier, but often necessary in order to fight more frequently. The more you battle, the more you will also get to test your strategies, finding general strategies that are successful, and strategies successful against specific opponents.</p>
  <p>
   Q: Who to battle?<br />
   A: Fight with higher level opponents to get more experience, and lower level opponents for easier wins. Fight with strangers to test your strategies against a variety of opposing strategies, and fight with friends in order to experiment with and perfect the success of your strategies.</p>

  <h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

  <p>In order to battle, a challenge must be exchanged between two pets. Announcing your pet's greatness to rivals and boasting of their fighting prowess is a long and respectable tradition in the animal kingdom, and in this way you will compete in the everlasting battle royal deciding the greatest among the pets.</p>

  <h4 id="challenging-pets">Challenging Pets</h4>
  <p>In order to challenge or be challenged, your pet's occupation must first be set to 'prowling'. It's possible to challenge any pet from their profile, and when your pet has been challenged, you will be notified on a number of screens, including your pet's main profile, their combat profile, and their challenges screen.</p>
  <p>When you challenge a pet, you'll be taken to the challenge screen where you can see a side-by-side comparison of the two fighters. To complete the challenge, you must either choose a saved strategy to use or else build a new strategy for the battle. Once you've issued a challenge, you need but wait until your opponent accepts or declines. If you change your mind before your opponent has responded, you may also cancel the challenge. </p>
  <p>When your pet receives a challenge, you'll have the option to accept or decline it. At this point, you may wish to size up your opponent by viewing their profile, and then make your decision. If you accept, you'll be taken to the challenge screen, where you must either choose a saved strategy to use or else build a new strategy for the battle.</p>
  <p>Once both pets have chosen their strategies, the battle is resolved, and the fighters can review outcome.</p>

  <h4 id="challenging-packs">Challenging Packs</h4>
  <p>If your pet is especially courageous or simply wants to raise the odds that their challenge will be accepted, they can challenge a pack of pets to battle. All pack members will see the challenge, and any of them may accept or decline it on behalf of their pack. If your pack is challenged, you will see the challenges on your pack profile and pet's own challenge screen.</p>
  <p>Once a pack member has accepted the challenge, battle proceeds as usual between the two pets.</p>

  <h4 id="open-challenges">Open Challenges</h4>
  <p>If a pet has no reservations about the enemy and owns no fear, they can issue an open challenge which any other pet may then accept. Open challenges are visible from a number of areas, and can be accepted on a first-come, first-fight basis. When you accept another pet's open challenge, you'll proceed to the challenge screen, select a strategy, and resolve the battle as normal.</p>
  <p>Your pet can issue an open challenge from their combat profile. The disadvantage of an open challenge, obviously, is that you'll have no idea who you might be battling.</p>

  <h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>
  <p>Combat is the primary means of gaining experience for your pet. The amount of experience your pet will receive pet battle depends on several factors.</p>
  <p>First, a pet will always receive a minimum of 1 experience for battling.</p>
  <p>Second, the winning pet will receive experience equal to the power of their battle strategy.</p>
  <p>Third, a pet will always receive an experience bonus for using their favorite actions in their strategies.</p>
  <p>Fourth, a pet will always receive an experience bonus whenever they undercut their opponent.</p>
  <p>Fifth, wise humans and sensor items provide an experience bonus if active during the battle.</p>
  <p>As your pet acquires experience they'll progress through their breed's levels, becoming increasing stronger after obtaining each level. With each rank they reach, subsequent levels become harder to obtain, and require increasingly more experience.</p>

  <h3 id="signs">Signs</h3>
  <p>Your pet can 'sign' with other pets, expressing themselves through the lingua franca of the animal kingdom by (1) Grooming, (2) Hissing, (3) Purring, and (4) Play.</p>
  <p>It's possible to sign with a pet while viewing their profile, although any two pets can only exchange one sign per day. Depending on the sign, different minor effects occur which tire the first pet and restore the second. In this fashion, pets can conduct minor strategies either with friends or against enemies.</p>
  <h4>Sign Types</h4>
  <p>1. Grooming: costs -3 endurance, restores +1 health</p>
  <p>2. Hissing: costs -5 endurance, depletes -5 endurance</p>
  <p>3. Purring: costs -1 endurance, restores +1 endurance</p>
  <p>4. Play: costs -3 endurance, gives 3 endurance</p>

  <h3 id="messages">Messages</h3>
  <p>Pets can send private messages to each other to introduce themselves, chat, plan strategies, taunt a foe before battle, and so forth. Messages will show up in your pet's inbox, which can accessed from their profile. You can also message other pets directly while viewing their profiles. Sent messages are stored in your outbox, which is also accessible from your profile as well.</p>
  <p>You can also send a messages to a pack you may wish to join, or receive a message from a pack inviting you to join, or  else send messages to your fellow pack members.</p>
  <p>You may also occasionally receive system messages about important world events or game status updates.</p>
